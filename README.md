# CleanCode exercise

## As a attendee I want to practise CleanCode and the Boy Scout rule
This kata is designed to work for practising small refactorings, on mastering your IDE and your execution speed, as well as your communication in pair.

## Playing the kata
This kata is designed to be played in pairs (but you can also play it alone if you must, and it also work in small mobs).

There are several stages, you can do them in any order. Your goal, as a team, is to perform them the fastest you can. You can see that as a video game [speedrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrun), or [rallying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallying).

## Instructions for the stages
For each stage, instructions can be found in the source code. You can also find them here.

### Stage 1
Uncomment the tests, and make them pass.

### Stage 2
Refactor until there is no else, you think the code is clean, and all the tests pass.

### Stage 3
Remove all the code duplications.

### Stage 4
Make this code clean.

### Stage 5
Refactor this code until all methods body is <= 5 lines, and you find the code clean.
